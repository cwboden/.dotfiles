                    <p class="small">
                        Design patterns, originally coined from the book <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em> by the "Gang of Four", are powerful tools developers can use to keep their code clean, readable, and extensible. I've grown to be a big proponent of design patterns and I'm surprised they aren't taught more in classes considering their use.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Recently, I've discovered a <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com">website</a> stressing design patterns and their possible use in game development. The author has experience from Electronic Arts and provides clear examples. I would strongly recommend this as a resource for those interested in design patterns. Not only does he expand upon the "Gang of Four's" design principles, but the author also gives examples of other patterns that have proved useful in his career.

                    <h3>How Nintendo Continues to Innovate in the Gaming Industry</h3>
                    <p class="subtitle">29 July 2018</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="small">
                        Nintendo has proved time and time again that they don't need "next-gen" hardware to do well in the console market. With almost 20 million Nintendo Switch devices sold since its release only a year and a half ago, the Switch proves that it can compete with Xbox and Playstation. But what makes Nintendo impress me is not just that they can stay competetive in the market, but that they can do it with an innovative and original console idea. The Switch bridges the gap between portability and power, allowing users to enjoy Nintendo goodness wherever they may be.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        In the past, Nintendo juggled focusing on their portable platform: the Gameboy, Gameboy SP, and eventually DS and 3DS lineups, and their console platform: the NES, Nintendo 64, the Gamecube, and recently the Wii and Wii U. Now that the Switch has been introduced, the distinction has been drastically reduced. This enabled developers to build their games for a single console while allowing users to enjoy the games as they choose: from the comfort of their living room TV or on the go.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Finally, the focus on a seamless local multiplayer experience is something only Nintendo seems to be focusing on with many of their new titles. Games like Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros. are known for being great games to play with friends in the same room, rather than solely online. What compounds the exerience is the ability to quickly add new controllers by instantly pairing them to the device. This makes jumping into a game quick since players don't have to fumble around with Bluetooth options to pair their device.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Overall, Nintendo and their newest console have demonstrated to me their resilience in the market and their willingness to innovate and maintain their philosophy. The Switch is not just focused on beautiful games but quality games devoted to user enjoyment.

                    <h3>Sailing the Belizean Coastline</h3>
                    <p class="subtitle">15 July 2018</p>
                    <img src="img/blog/belize.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                    <hr>
                    <p class="small">
                        This past week I had the pleasure of sailing around Belize with my family. This was the third sailing trip we've done together, but this one involved some of the toughest weather and volatile waters.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        We first arrived in Belize City, where we took a puddle-jumper to Placencia. There, my father and I sat through a two-hour briefing about the boat and the cayes to ensure our safety during the trip. By the time the briefing had finished, it was too late to embark, so we ate dinner in Placencia and spent the night on the boat.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        The next morning, we left for the first of many islands we visited on the trip. It was a long first voyage, directly into the wind on a rainy day, so we didn't do much sailing. Once we arrived at Hatchet Cay, we all took turns jumping off the boat into the warm Belizean waters. There was also an island nearby with a resort that served fresh Lionfish tacos, as well as some cocktails, which we enjoyed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        The following day, we headed north, stopping at Lagoon Cay for some kayaking before continuing to the Pelican Cayes. For dinner, we visited the nearby Hideaway Cay, where afamily of three had constructed a restaurant and a cabana, despite there being no real land. The dinner was incredibly satisfying, and we even enjoyed a rum cake baked by the family's daughter.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        On the third day of travel, we visited South Water Cay, home to incredible snorkeling near Carrie Bow. We had first visited Tobacco Cay, but aside from some beautiful colored houses, there was not much notable. At South Water we also ate on the island, enjoying some unique ginger shrimp and countless bowls of chicken soup.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        At Thatch Cay we discovered a beautiful resort. Here we spent one of my favorite nights, where we ate dinner with some of the travellers staying in the resort. They were impressed that we were living on a boat, while we were all slightly jealous that they got to sleep somewhere it wouldn't rock.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Our last day of travel took us to a small Cay near Placencia. With our flight the next day, we needed a mooring close to where we would depart. After grabbing a mooring, we met another group sailing, but they had only just begun their first day. We gave them our spare supplies we didn't use in return from some rum and friendly conversation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        The next day, we unloaded everything from the boat and prepared for a day of travel home. Though exhausted and looking forward to my own bed, I felt relaxed from a week out on the open waters.

                    <h3>Easy to Use Tools for Larger Codebases</h3>
                    <p class="subtitle">6 July 2018</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="small">
                        I've recently started using tools to aid the development of the game I've been working on, and I believe CMake, GoogleTest, and Git Hooks are not only incredibly powerful, but also easy to setup and use. I have only just started learning them, but I imagine they will be continuously useful.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        CMake was a tool that I've heard of many a time, but I was so used to manually creating my own Makefiles that I never took the time to learn how to use CMake. While I still don't fully understand the intricacies of the platform, I respect the ability for CMake to deploy a build solution regardless of the operating system and compiler. Setting it up required me to read through the <a target="_blank" href="https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/">basic tutorial</a> which mainly introduces concepts, but it got me on the right track, and I hope to learn more.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        I have always been a proponent of quality testing of code. Not only does it ensure that your code works, but more importantly, it shows you where it breaks. GoogleTest is a framework that takes tests and presents them in an easy-to-visualize way, making problems visible at a glance. Like with CMake, I have only scratched the surface with GoogleTest via their <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/README.md">README</a>, but it was enough to get me started and interested.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        I have a bit more experience with Git Hooks, given that I used them last semester, but I still believe I have much to learn. The idea behind Git Hooks is to integrate a series of scripts that are called whenever a corresponding action is called via a contributer (push, commit, etc.). The scripts have a variety of uses, but I mainly used them to ensure unit tests are created and working before allowing a commit. There are limitless possibilities, though, that can be read about on the <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks">Git Wiki</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Developers have spent tons of time creating frameworks that can provide utility to projects large and small. Finding the best of these tools can take work, and learning to use them can take more. But the earlier you start learning, the sooner you can learn to use them.

                    <h3>The Importance of Diving into Game Development</h3>
                    <p class="subtitle">1 July 2018</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="small">
                        Most people understand that game developent is difficult. There are a lot of moving parts: how to design the flavor and story, the playstyle of the game, or what platform it will be developed for. But stressing about every little detail before starting means that the idea will never be completed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        When I first tried creating a game, I made the same mistake. I was thinking about how to design every little aspect of the game, what language I should use for development, and even drawing sprites for things I hadn't even programmed yet. Today I'm taking the plunge of writing basic code to get the game going. Drawing something on the screen, making it move around, and building off of that. I think the idea to dive in will free me from over-organizing the game without turning any ideas into reality.
