# DE3584

*Questions for Scott:*
- Can we treat a read-only file system from subprocess differently?
- Are there any other approaches to handle this error more gracefully?
- How can we localize a read-only file system error to the node that's reporting it?
- [MSU-related] How can we handle this when the Tunables system finds a read-only file system?

*Chat with Scott:*
Might be able to scope the error inside of devices_py.[ch] and return a "general" error to catch this problem, similar to list_data_devices_error
Talk with Charge about changes to devices.py
Should we always recuse the node if devices.py fails? --> Leaning no, Anthony says we might be fine
Perhaps add a step to ensure the boot drive is healthy before starting other subsystems (and recuse from there)
See who's worked on the boot drive code in the past for insight

Cases of writing to the boot drive:
- config file changes
- logging (though, fails silently)
- tunables
- device enumeration
- provision_hw

*Chat with Anthony:*
Possible test: Set boot drive to read-only (or remove via ipmi), see what blows up

Almost any call to subprocess could cause an error reading the boot drive
Provision runs before anything else -- can we detect in provision to stop
Provision only runs during container restart, may not detect issues on quorum restart
Will likely need to generate some data to flush to the drive to check if it's still around (doesn't seem like there's a better option)
Try to send the logs to another cluster, since the misbehaving node will not be able to write to logs

*Next Steps:*
[ ] Sync with Molly on the issue, see if there's a timeline we're looking to meet
[ ] Reproduce the problem, ideally in our lab
[ ] Classify failure modes as best we can, might be a wild goose chase
[ ] Add a check in Quorum Formation to detect issues in the boot drive
    - Will QFT be impacted by this check?
