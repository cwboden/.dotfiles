# DE3585
Appears similar to DE3464 in that the command `ipmitool fru print 0` fails.
Though in this case, it fails multiple times -- the previous defect was only a
single occurance that was fixed during retry.

## Gap in Log Output
There was a notable break in the logs between 2021-06-23 and 2021-08-07, not
sure what exactly happened yet.

## Uploaded AHS Logs
I uploaded the AHS logs to HPE and found nothing. There were no events
registered after 2021-07-15. Is that normal?

It's especially strange how many warnings there were throughout the month of
June, but then only one notification in July and none in August.
