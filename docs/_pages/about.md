In my free time, I enjoy curating video games, climbing and bouldering, cooking
unique, delicious food, competing in ultimate frisbee and volleyball, and
playing any tabletop game I can get my hands on.

While orginally from California, I've travelled the world in search of
educational opportunities, unforgettable experiences, and authentic cuisine. I
hope to visit every continent, I've still got Australia and Antarctica to go!

When it comes to programming, I'm a big proponent of automation and test-driven
design. I also consider clean, readable code high priority for big projects. In
addition, computer science education is an important part of my identity.

I hope to pass these ideas on writing quality code to my students.  I find
teaching with metaphors to be extremely effective and I believe that
introductory students can learn a lot by correctly testing their code.
