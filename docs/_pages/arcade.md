A small collection of games I have tinkered with. Sometimes there is learning to
be had and sometimes I get bored of projects and drop them.

## Thrixel

|**Release Date:**|06 May 2022|
|**Developer:**|Self|
{: .notice--info}

A pixelated knock-off of Asher Vollmer's
[*Threes!*](https://play.threesgame.com/), with a few minor differences. Combine
**1**s and **2**s to create **3**s, then join like numbers together to see how
high of a number you can get! In this version you win once you can get a **96**.

Created using `increpare`'s [PuzzleScript](https://www.puzzlescript.net), which
is incredible. If you have an interest in 2D tile-based puzzles, I would
encourage you to check it (and [this GDC
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_okgL6HJX8), from which I learned about
it) out.  I'm excited to see what else is possible with this engine.
