A small collection of games I have tinkered with. Sometimes there is learning to
be had and sometimes I get bored of projects and drop them.

## Hogger

|**Release Date:**|10 Jul 2023|
|**Developer:**|Self|
{: .notice--info}

An abandoned entry to [GMTK's 2023 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023). I
don't think it had enough substance to submit, but it was fun to create
something, no matter how small.

This year's theme was "Roles Reversed", which I attempted to use to make a
puzzle-forward commentary on cars and nature in a play on Konami's famous
[*Frogger (1981)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger).

## Thrixel

|**Release Date:**|06 May 2023|
|**Developer:**|Self|
{: .notice--info}

A pixelated knock-off of Asher Vollmer's
[*Threes!*](https://play.threesgame.com/), with a few minor differences. Combine
**1**s and **2**s to create **3**s, then join like numbers together to see how
high of a number you can get! In this version you win once you can get a **96**.

Created using `increpare`'s [PuzzleScript](https://www.puzzlescript.net), which
is incredible. If you have an interest in 2D tile-based puzzles, I would
encourage you to check it (and [this GDC
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_okgL6HJX8), from which I learned about
it) out.  I'm excited to see what else is possible with this engine.
