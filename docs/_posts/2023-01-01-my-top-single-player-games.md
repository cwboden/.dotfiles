## Overview
I was recently looking through my library and was surprised how many years
had passed since some of my favorite games were released. Many people are always
focused on new titles, which makes sense, as fresh technology and ideas will
deliver new experiences, building off of the learned techniques of the past.

So I wanted to list out some of my favorite titles, by year, mostly as a
personal artifact of my experience, but also a log of how the industry has
changed. Worth calling out that I'm listing these games based on the year *I*
played them, not when they were released.

To me, it makes sense "spiritually" for this to be released at the turn of the
year, so I'm listing that as the release date. Without further ado, here are the
games:

## The Games

### 2014: The Stanley Parable

|**Release Date:**| 17 Oct 2013|
|**Developer:**| Galactic Cafe|
|**Publisher:**| Galactic Cafe|
{: .notice--info}

*The Stanley Parable* was, for many reasons, one of the major breakthrough games
in the [walking simulator
genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game#Walking_simulators). While
the *gameplay* mechanics are only a light series of choices the player makes on
their adventure, the *narrative* mechanics are witty and respond to the players
actions. This is a slight departure from previous games in the genre, like
*Myst*, which instead focus almost entirely on puzzle-solving.

As a result, the game encourages you to play through it multiple times to
experience the outcome of your choices, especially ones you might not otherwise
have made. These stories then end in a variety of absurd ways from stopping a
mind control device puppeteering over everyone in the office to realizing the
whole thing was all a dream.

When I first played through the game, the strange mechanics really stuck with
me. In particular, it felt unlike so many other games, due to the focus on
narrative, environment, and player interaction rather than novel gameplay
mechanics. While true, walking simulators can be a slog with poor pacing, *The
Stanley Parable*'s eclectic variety of plotlines make discovering a new ending
something players will want to pursue as each is distinct from the rest.

We can see this trend of variety as a means of enticing the player used by
walking simulators released since. *Firewatch*, for example, involves the
protagonist frequently communicating via walkie talkie with a narrator-like,
secondary character that responds to your actions, much like the Narrator in
*The Stanley Parable*.

    The games above, <em>Firewatch (left)</em> and <em>What Remains of Edith
    Finch (right)</em> use similar ideas of narrative-gameplay coupling as in
    <em>The Stanley Parable</em>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Similarly, *What Remains of Edith Finch* contains a wide variety of disparate
experiences as the player learns about the history of each member of the family.
The interaction with the environment changes and feels tightly bound with the
narrative, creating a satisfying "Aha!" moment for both solving the puzzle *and*
uncovering new details within the story.

By coupling the narrative experience more tightly to the gameplay via responsive
narration and impactful player choice, *The Stanley Parable* set the stage for
the future of walking simulators and will remain a foundational piece in my
video game repertoire.

### 2015: Fez

|**Release Date:**|1 May 2013 (PC) |
|**Developer:**|Polytron Corporation|
|**Publisher:**|Trapdoor |
{: .notice--info}

Despite some of the [controversy around the release of the game and cancellation
of the sequel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez_(video_game)#Canceled_sequel),
*Fez* caught my eye due to it's novel, hybrid 2D / 3D technology, cryptic
puzzles, and player-driven exploration and discovery. While completionists may
be taken back by how extremely detailed and arcane the solutions to certain
puzzles are, the game allows players with a variety of experience to reach a
satisfying ending.

Some added context, for those who haven't played (spoilers abound!): *Fez* is a
puzzle platformer with a front-loaded focus on platforming and a back-loaded
focus on puzzling. Players explore a detailed, 2D, pixel world using the
protagonist's ability to "rotate" the map between four "sides" of a 3D cube to
change the location and orientation of platforms, secrets, or even the player.

The goal is to collect 32 cubes which will fuse together to fix the "glitch"
that gave the protagonist, Gomez, the ability to rotate the world in the first
place. However, while collecting 32 cubes is enough to beat the game, there is
*another* set of 32 cubes, called anti-cubes, which are more difficult to find.

Realistically, anyone who beats the game will likely discover a few anti-cubes
along the way, leaving some loose ends to explore further. This sort of scaling
difficulty is what makes an esoteric game like *Fez* appeal to a wider audience:
some will finish the game and call it there, while others will be intrigued by
the anti-cubes and explore the depths of the game.

And there's a *lot* of depth. The game itself has ***two*** distinct languages
that the player must decode to solve puzzles. The first is more straightforward:
A series of [tetrominos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino) which instruct
the player to perform specific inputs (e.g. `Up`, `Down`, `A`, and `B`).

<figure class="align-center half">

    src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/fez-tetromino.jpg"
    alt="A block with a tetromino, from Fez.">
  <img

    alt="A block with symbols from the Zu language, from Fez.">
  <figcaption>
    Players looking to uncover all of the secrets of <em>Fez</em> must learn to
    decode both the Tetromino symbols <em>(left)</em> and the Zu language
    <em>(right)</em>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The other language, referred to as "Zu", is effectively a [Dingbat
font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbat), where traditional, alphabet
characters are replaced by symbols. The player can, over the course of the game,
find rooms that clue them into the real letters associated with each symbol.
From there, decoding messages just takes some pen, paper, and the discovered
translations.

By its conclusion, players will feel *Fez* evolve from an exploratory
platforming game, with lots of fresh ideas due to the 2D-3D mechanics, to an
enigmatic puzzler, detailed enough to require handwritten notes. While other
indie platformers like *Braid* or *Celeste* capture one side of the formula,
it's rare to see a game excel in multiple fields.
