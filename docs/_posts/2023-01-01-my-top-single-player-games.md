## Overview
I was recently looking through my library and was surprised how many years
had passed since some of my favorite games were released. Many people are always
focused on new titles, which makes sense, as fresh technology and ideas will
deliver new experiences, building off of the learned techniques of the past.

So I wanted to list out some of my favorite titles, by year, mostly as a
personal artifact of my experience, but also a log of how the industry has
changed. Worth calling out that I'm listing these games based on the year *I*
played them, not when they were released.

To me, it makes sense "spiritually" for this to be released at the turn of the
year, so I'm listing that as the release date. Without further ado, here are the
games:

## The Games

### 2014: The Stanley Parable

|**Release Date:**| 17 Oct 2013|
|**Developer:**| Galactic Cafe|
|**Publisher:**| Galactic Cafe|
{: .notice--info}

*The Stanley Parable* was, for many reasons, one of the major breakthrough games
in the [walking simulator
genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game#Walking_simulators). While
the *gameplay* mechanics are only a light series of choices the player makes on
their adventure, the *narrative* mechanics are witty and respond to the players
actions.

As a result, the game encourages you to play through it multiple times to
experience the outcome of your choices, especially ones you might not otherwise
have made. These stories then end in a variety of absurd ways from stopping a
mind control device puppeteering over everyone in the office to realizing the
whole thing was all a dream.

When I first played through the game, the strange mechanics really stuck with
me. In particular, it felt unlike so many other games, due to the focus on
narrative, environment, and player interaction rather than novel gameplay
mechanics. While true, walking simulators can be a slog with poor pacing, *The
Stanley Parable*'s eclectic variety of plotlines make discovering a new ending
something players will want to pursue as each is distinct from the rest.
