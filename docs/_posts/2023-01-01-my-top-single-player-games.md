## Overview
I was recently looking through my library and was surprised how many years
had passed since some of my favorite games were released. Many people are always
focused on new titles, which makes sense, as fresh technology and ideas will
deliver new experiences, building off of the learned techniques of the past.

So I wanted to list out some of my favorite titles, by year, mostly as a
personal artifact of my experience, but also a log of how the industry has
changed. Worth calling out that I'm listing these games based on the year *I*
played them, not when they were released.

To me, it makes sense "spiritually" for this to be released at the turn of the
year, so I'm listing that as the release date. Without further ado, here are the
games:

## The Games

### 2014: The Stanley Parable

|**Release Date:**|17 Oct 2013|
|**Developer:**|Galactic Cafe|
|**Publisher:**|Galactic Cafe|
{: .notice--info}

*The Stanley Parable* was, for many reasons, one of the major breakthrough games
in the [walking simulator
genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game#Walking_simulators). While
the *gameplay* mechanics are only a light series of choices the player makes on
their adventure, the *narrative* mechanics are witty and respond to the players
actions. This is a slight departure from previous games in the genre, like
*Myst*, which instead focus almost entirely on puzzle-solving.

As a result, the game encourages you to play through it multiple times to
experience the outcome of your choices, especially ones you might not otherwise
have made. These stories then end in a variety of absurd ways from stopping a
mind control device puppeteering over everyone in the office to realizing the
whole thing was all a dream.

When I first played through the game, the strange mechanics really stuck with
me. In particular, it felt unlike so many other games, due to the focus on
narrative, environment, and player interaction rather than novel gameplay
mechanics. While true, walking simulators can be a slog with poor pacing, *The
Stanley Parable*'s eclectic variety of plotlines make discovering a new ending
something players will want to pursue as each is distinct from the rest.

We can see this trend of variety as a means of enticing the player used by
walking simulators released since. *Firewatch*, for example, involves the
protagonist frequently communicating via walkie talkie with a narrator-like,
secondary character that responds to your actions, much like the Narrator in
*The Stanley Parable*.

    The games above, <em>Firewatch (left)</em> and <em>What Remains of Edith
    Finch (right)</em> use similar ideas of narrative-gameplay coupling as in
    <em>The Stanley Parable</em>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Similarly, *What Remains of Edith Finch* contains a wide variety of disparate
experiences as the player learns about the history of each member of the family.
The interaction with the environment changes and feels tightly bound with the
narrative, creating a satisfying "Aha!" moment for both solving the puzzle *and*
uncovering new details within the story.

By coupling the narrative experience more tightly to the gameplay via responsive
narration and impactful player choice, *The Stanley Parable* set the stage for
the future of walking simulators and will remain a foundational piece in my
video game repertoire.

    alt="Fez splash art">
</figure>
### 2015: Fez

|**Release Date:**|1 May 2013 (PC)|
|**Developer:**|Polytron Corporation|
|**Publisher:**|Trapdoor|
{: .notice--info}

Despite some of the [controversy around the release of the game and cancellation
of the sequel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez_(video_game)#Canceled_sequel),
*Fez* caught my eye due to it's novel, hybrid 2D / 3D technology, cryptic
puzzles, and player-driven exploration and discovery. While completionists may
be taken back by how extremely detailed and arcane the solutions to certain
puzzles are, the game allows players with a variety of experience to reach a
satisfying ending.

Some added context, for those who haven't played (spoilers abound!): *Fez* is a
puzzle platformer with a front-loaded focus on platforming and a back-loaded
focus on puzzling. Players explore a detailed, 2D, pixel world using the
protagonist's ability to "rotate" the map between four "sides" of a 3D cube to
change the location and orientation of platforms, secrets, or even the player.

The goal is to collect 32 cubes which will fuse together to fix the "glitch"
that gave the protagonist, Gomez, the ability to rotate the world in the first
place. However, while collecting 32 cubes is enough to beat the game, there is
*another* set of 32 cubes, called anti-cubes, which are more difficult to find.

Realistically, anyone who beats the game will likely discover a few anti-cubes
along the way, leaving some loose ends to explore further. This sort of scaling
difficulty is what makes an esoteric game like *Fez* appeal to a wider audience:
some will finish the game and call it there, while others will be intrigued by
the anti-cubes and explore the depths of the game.

And there's a *lot* of depth. The game itself has ***two*** distinct languages
that the player must decode to solve puzzles. The first is more straightforward:
A series of [tetrominos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino) which instruct
the player to perform specific inputs (e.g. `Up`, `Down`, `A`, and `B`).

<figure class="align-center half">

    alt="A block with symbols from the Zu language, from Fez.">
  <figcaption>
    Players looking to uncover all of the secrets of <em>Fez</em> must learn to
    decode both the Tetromino symbols <em>(left)</em> and the Zu language
    <em>(right)</em>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The other language, referred to as "Zu", is effectively a [Dingbat
font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbat), where traditional, alphabet
characters are replaced by symbols. The player can, over the course of the game,
find rooms that clue them into the real letters associated with each symbol.
From there, decoding messages just takes some pen, paper, and the discovered
translations.

By its conclusion, players will feel *Fez* evolve from an exploratory
platforming game, with lots of fresh ideas due to the 2D-3D mechanics, to an
enigmatic puzzler, detailed enough to require handwritten notes. While other
indie platformers like *Braid* or *Celeste* capture one side of the formula,
it's rare to see a game excel in multiple fields.

    alt="Undertale splash art">
</figure>
### 2016: Undertale

|**Release Date:**|15 Sep 2015|
|**Developer:**|Toby Fox|
|**Publisher:**|Toby Fox|
{: .notice--info}

Undertale is a difficult game to describe without playing it. A large part of
the experience is based on subverting typical expectations from JRPG titles,
like *Earthbound*, which it was inspired by.

Players are offered the choice to play through the game either using the
(intentionally) lackluster combat mechanics to defeat enemies, where they use a
single attack to deal damage. Or they can learn how to befriend enemies,
finishing combat via "mercy".

The pacifist mechanic expands upon the games narrative-driven experience,
allowing the player to learn more about common enemies or even bosses like
Papyrus and Sans. But what drew me to the game is that the player is always
offered the *choice* to follow up on these experiences. Someone looking to
min-max the game might complete the entire thing wondering what all of the hype
was about.

Of course, the player's main guide at the beginning, Toriel, teaches the player
how to *actually* play the game, by letting them know they shouldn't try to harm
the creatures of Undertale. But it's not unreasonable that a player might ignore
that approach as, initially, it also seems fairly dull.

Ultimately, *Undertale* is a game that requires players to get invested in its
world to really appreciate the game. The goofy humor and heartfelt characters
may draw many players in, though I've also seen players try to rush through the
game like a standard JRPG, missing *Undertale*'s "true nature" and some of the
great moments along the way.

### 2017: The Witness

|**Release Date:**|26 Jan 2016|
|**Developer:**|Thekla, Inc.|
|**Publisher:**|Thekla, Inc.|
{: .notice--info}

The Witness is one of my favorite puzzle games because it encapsulates the
feeling of discovery using its language-less explanation of puzzles and
concepts. The simple, "draw a line" puzzle mechanic is remixed in dozens of
unique ways with each mechanic able to give players that "Aha!" moment.

Early in the game, the puzzles are tight and straightforward, giving players the
ability to experiment and figure out how new symbols influence the answer to a
puzzle. As the puzzles increase in difficulty, those ideas may be challenged,
forcing players to reconsider if the symbol actually means what they previously
assumed.

<figure class="align-center half">
  <img
    src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/the-witness-puzzle-easy.jpg"
    alt="An easier, starting puzzle from The Witness.">
  <img
    src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/the-witness-puzzle-hard.jpg"
    alt="A more difficult puzzle from The Witness.">
  <figcaption>
    The puzzles in <em>The Witness</em> start simple and are well-bounded so
    players can expiriment and come to a solution. Later puzzles have an
    expanded amount of possible state, ensuring players prove they understand a
    concept.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

By the end of *The Witness*, symbols are combined into new puzzles with further
expanded state. To complete some of the game's final puzzles, players must prove
they understand the intricacies of each mechanic -- and it would be almost
impossible to give the correct answer without having that understanding due to
their size.

From a technological perspective, the game is also quite impressive. It runs on
a custom engine which enables the game to be played on iOS (though I wouldn't
recommend it). There was also substantial work done to [combine levels into a
single zone that could also be independently edited within version control](
https://web.archive.org/web/20120108064326/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/39338/Indepth_Concurrent_World_Editing_On_The_Cheap.php).

Like *Fez*, there's lots of stages of completion to the game. The player only
needs to activate eight of the eleven lasers to reach the end, though even after
completing the three additional levels, there are still hundreds of puzzles left
to find, hidden all over the island. Years later, there's still more I haven't
found in *The Witness*.

### 2018: Doki Doki Literature Club

|**Release Date:**| 22 Sep 2017|
|**Developer:**|Team Salvato|
|**Publisher:**|Team Salvato|
{: .notice--info}

This is one of the strangest games I've played. Before spoiling anything, I want
to call out that [the game is free](https://ddlc.moe/) and a fairly short (~4
hour) experience. I would recommend against reading into spoilers about the
game, though be warned there is some graphic self-harm content (which will be
very *not* obvious from the vibe of the game).

*Doki Doki* can be a hard game to talk about, since the game is a meta-heavy
experience with multiple plots:
  - **The Plot**: The story that happens to the characters as part of the visual
      novel game. The protagonist joins a high school literature club and writes
      poems in a thinly-veiled dating sim.
  - **The Meta Plot**: The story that occurs between playthroughs of the game.
      Monika, the club's leader (but not an option in the dating sim) gains
      sentinence and modifies the game's code to profess her love for the
      *human player* of the game.

The plot follows all the tropes of a visual novel. The poems you write are
clearly meant to reflect the objectified character traits of the different love
interests in the club. Your childhood friend professes her love to the
protagonist on the first day of the game. The game's assets are polished and
hide the game's horror/thriller meta-plot nicely inside of a cutesy anime game.

The meta plot shows the destructive nature of obsession and our flaws. The
characters in the game are manipulated by Monika to showcase the extremes of
their negative traits, poisoning the relationships the player forms during the
visual novel. They're eventually driven to killing themselves or deleted by
Monika until she's the only option remaining. In a way, the dating sim shell
still did what is was meant to do -- romance the player -- but in a creepy twist
on the genre.

Since playing, they have released a "Plus" version of the game with additional
storylines and endings, though I haven't tried it yet. I'm not sure how much
would be modified from the main story (or how they'd make certain mechanics work
on the Switch, for example) but perhaps it's worth revisiting after my trip here
down memory lane.

    alt="Return of the Obra Dinn splash art">

### 2019: Return of the Obra Dinn

|**Release Date:**|18 Oct 2018 (PC)|
|**Developer:**|Lucas Pope|
|**Publisher:**|3909 LLC|
{: .notice--info}

Good detective games can be hard to find. Designers must work to balance the
game so that it isn't too hard to find important clues or uncover the mystery
while still enabling player expression and keeping the joy of discovery.

*Return of the Obra Dinn* accomplishes this using an expanding tome of
identities that the player fills in to denote which characters have perished, by
what means, and who (if anyone) killed them. The book will inform the player
they're correct only when three identities are *completely* filled in (identity,
means of death, and adversary). This ensures players are actually paying
attention and filling things in while they go, but also allows some guesswork to
help pave the way.

In addition to the mystery of deaths aboard the Obra Dinn, there are also
other-worldly forces at work that make the world more interesting to explore.
For example, one of the the mermaids' shells can be seen from the ship, even
from the start (though the player will have to deduce this sparkling talisman
throughout the story). Even aspects of the Momento Mori (the pocketwatch) which
allows players to see into the snapshots of the past has consistent rules it
follows, further revealed by the storyline with the monkeypaw, which illustrates
how a remnant of the deceased is required to look back at the moment they died.

To me, *Obra Dinn* is a modern take on the detective game formula. There are
innovative ways of enabling player expression (especially those who don't have
dedicated diorama entries for their demise) while also some in-game mysteries to
explore, like how the mystical pocket watch enables your investigation. I've
recently also enjoyed *Case of the Golden Idol* which uses similar mechanics and
inner-world mysteries to drive an impressive, snapshot-based experience.

    (since that ability just won't say anything)
- Focus on reading, great VA content gives it legs

- Try to keep this one short, as I want to write an in-depth review.

## My Reflection
