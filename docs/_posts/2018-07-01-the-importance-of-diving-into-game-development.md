title: The Importance of Diving into Game Development
---

Most people understand that game developent is difficult. There are a lot of moving parts: how to
design the flavor and story, the playstyle of the game, or what platform it will be developed for.
But stressing about every little detail before starting means that the idea will never be completed.

When I first tried creating a game, I made the same mistake. I was thinking about how to design
every little aspect of the game, what language I should use for development, and even drawing
sprites for things I hadn't even programmed yet. Today I'm taking the plunge of writing basic code
to get the game going. Drawing something on the screen, making it move around, and building off of
that. I think the idea to dive in will free me from over-organizing the game without turning any
ideas into reality.
