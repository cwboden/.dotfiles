## Overview
That's not a typo in the title. While the baseline routes through each of *Neon
White*'s ninety-seven levels are challenging and zippy, they are designed to be
both carefully explored and naturally discovered, with multiple speedrunning
optimizations baked into every level.

Let's dive into one of them to highlight the choreographed nature of the game's
design. We'll be looking at *Covenant: Hanging Gardens*, the first level of the
sixth mission. But first, here's a quick explanation of the game for the
uninitiated:

### *Neon White* Brief
As a demon slayer in Heaven, you must complete each level by killing every demon
and making it to the Finish. The player can pick up weapon cards to shoot at
demons, though they can also discard those weapons for powerful movement
abilities.

    src="{{ page.image_directory }}/balloon-demon.webp"
    alt="A balloon demon">
</figure>

The movement abilities -- which are also used to vanquish enemies -- lead to an
exciting, fluid, parkour-like experience, similar to *Mirror's Edge*, for
example. This is further **demon**strated by the fact that some of them are
deliberately designed to be jumped on, such as the Balloon Demon *(pictured
here)*.

While there are, sadly, no balloon demons in this level, it does contain the
following cards, for reference:

|Card|Weapon|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|`Elevate`|Pistol|Double jump|
|`Purify`|Machine Gun|Launch an explosive bomb|
|`Godspeed`|Rifle|Dash forward, destroying enemies|
|`Slam`|Uzi|Slam down, releasing a shockwave|

In addition, many of the demons are "infused" with a particular card, so they'll
always drop them when slain. Demons have characteristics based on their card,
but for the purposes of this walkthrough, we need only understand which card
they drop.

### An Extra Dimension of Speed
It's important to call out that while the levels are each *designed* for speed,
with players finding the fastest combination of firing and discarding their
weapon cards, there's no maximum time for any level. It's possible to complete
most levels at your own pace (including this one).

There's not a ton to explore with this dimension of speedrunning the game, but
it makes the game much more approachable, regardless of whether someone is a
speedrunner. And while we will see how different routes are baked into each
level, we can also appreciate that max times were not set.

Now we can jump into how someone would naturally progress through the level, if
they were speedrunning the intended route:
## The First Pass

### Introducing the Laser Traps
Immediately out of the gate, first-time players at *Covenant: Hanging Gardens*
are informed of a new mechanic -- Laser Traps -- that they will be learning
about over the course of the level. Fresh eyes will use their `Katana` on it,
quickly learning that the Laser Traps have 1HP and can destroy breakable
objects, like the door you need to move through.

  <figcaption>

    their `Katana` in order to move forward.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Next, the player turns the corner, picking up a `Godspeed` card and encountering
a new problem: Laser Traps pointing at them! The model design and placement of
the lasers prompts the player to jump the beams, shooting the two traps on the
way over. With the traps taken care of, the player can then continue into the
next room, discarding `Godspeed` to break through a door and continue to the
next section.

In this hallway, the player learns another dimension of the new Laser Traps: it
can also instantly kill them! Players can test it out by walking into the
demonic beams instead of hopping over them -- though their appearance (and that
the beam in the first room counts as a demon) already invites players to avoid
and destroy them.

The following leisurely walkaround to the door after destroying the traps gives
new players a chance to breathe, processing the mechanic a bit more, while more
experienced speed-runners might already be thinking about how to optimize away
the slow walk.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img
    src="{{ page.image_directory }}/hanging-gardens-first-enemy.jpg"
    alt="">
</figure>

After dashing through the wall with `Godspeed`, we are met with a familiar idea:
a Laser Trap pointing at a destroyable object. By striking it with `Katana`, the
player confirms what they may have already inferred, that the traps can also
kill enemies.

They'll then move onto some waterfall paths (which speed up player movement)
and repeat the process on the `Godspeed` demon. This teaches them another
important concept, since it takes two Laser Traps to kill the heftier `Godspeed`
demon.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img
    src="{{ page.image_directory }}/hanging-gardens-second-enemy.jpg"
    alt="">
</figure>

Moving forward, the player can collect the `Godspeed` card from the now-fallen
demon and use it to dash through a door into a room. There, aligned in a series,
is a Rube Goldberg machine of Laser Traps, ending in the door you need to move
through.

Since the door is on a high platform, you'll need to grab and discard `Elevate`
to reach the top, making sure to shoot the start of the Laser Trap chain.

The framing of the first Laser Trap in this room, similar to the spawn point,
draws the player's eye, which they then follow like a path of dominoes. Despite
it being the first level with a Laser Trap, players can piece together a variety
of mechanics using the building blocks established earlier.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img
    src="{{ page.image_directory }}/hanging-gardens-elevate-room.jpg"
    alt="">
</figure>

These ideas are then expanded further in later levels. For example, in
*Covenant: Race*, the player must run faster than a huge string of Laser Traps
to reach the end before being cut-off by the traps. Or how some of Neon Yellow's
signature levels -- where the player is unable to use the cards' movement
abilities -- use the Laser Traps as gates to different sections.

### Giving the Player a View
Following the `Elevate` room is a straightforward waterfall path with two
enemies, pointed at again by the Laser Traps. Weaponless, the player must use
their `Katana` to destroy the traps and slay the two demons, with the second one
providing a `Slam` card.

The `Slam` is then immediately discarded, killing another `Slam` demon below and
continuing on a waterfall path, picking up two `Purify` cards along the way.
Here is where the player arrives at a vista with the final section of the level
before them -- a perfect place to contemplate route improvements.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img
    src="{{ page.image_directory }}/hanging-gardens-ramp-before-drop.jpg"
    alt="">
</figure>

After receiving a Gold Medal on a level in *Neon White*, the game will reward
you with a hint shaped like a hand, hidden somewhere in the level. Once touching
the Hand, it will trace a path showing you a faster way to travel. The
difficulty, though, can often be figuring out *how* to move that way while still
taking care of the other demons.

We can see that this hint is placed where the player has full vision of the rest
of the level. It prompts the player to jump down directly to the goal, skipping
the next section, but doesn't explain how they can skip it. The player must
think -- from their well-placed vantage point -- about their next move.

The Hand inspires players to start thinking intricately about what parts of the
level they can zoom through by providing guidance, but not completely
demonstrating how they can skip the last section. But to round things out,
let's walkthrough the final, skippable section, for completion's sake.

### Finishing out the Level
As seen from the vista, the first `Purify` is used to break down the door. The
player must avoid some laser on their way into the structure, similar to the
first section of the level. This time, however, they're attached in a chain,
too.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img
    src="{{ page.image_directory }}/hanging-gardens-head-room-1.jpg"
    alt="">
</figure>

Next, the second `Purify` is discarded to destroy the demons, door, and start of
the Laser Trap chain at the end of the hallway. The player then collects a
`Stomp` from one of the demolished demons, quickly discarding it to crush
another demon/door/laser-chain group.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img
    src="{{ page.image_directory }}/hanging-gardens-final-stomp.jpg"
    alt="">
</figure>

Finally, the player collects another `Stomp` from the fallen demons and discards
it to dive below to the Finish, destroying the surrounding nearby demons and
completing the level. There's not a ton to learn in this section, as it was
meant to be optimized out, as evidenced by the Hand.

To sum it up, here is a diagram and corresponding path through the level. You
may need to download this image if you want zoom in. Opening it in another tab
also works.

## My Optimized Route
I'll now walk through my theoretical maximum. There are probably further
improvements to be made, including niche mechanics like deflecting bullets with
`Katana`, but this will cover what I believe are the intentionally designed
improvements.

Throughout the game, many of these discovered optimizations are, in reality,
baked into the level and hidden for the player to explore within their
attempts. Many of the rooms are intentionally designed to be completed quicker,
but that's thanks to careful level design and placement of enemies and weapon
cards.

### Through the Looking Glass
The first key route improvement is made once the player realizes that the
foliage-covered windows near the first `Godspeed` are actually open for you to
jump out of. This enables you to shoot the two Laser Traps you otherwise would
have dodged, then hop out the window onto some well-placed water paths.

One problem remains, though: the Laser Trap and demon below. Luckily, since the
player didn't use `Godspeed` on a door, they can deal with the trap from a
distance with a well-placed shot.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img
    src="{{ page.image_directory }}/hanging-gardens-sniper-shortcut-1.jpg"
    alt="Just beyond the window of the first section, gazing out at the next part of the level.">
  <figcaption>
    A view from just beyond the windows. The Laser Trap and demon are visible
    for the last shot before moving onto dealing with the Godspeed demon.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Note that each `Godspeed` card has four bullets, so the player is challenged to
shoot each of the three Laser Traps with accuracy, since they'll need `Godspeed`
to cross a gap later in the route. The first section has been crafted to enable
the player to smuggle out a `Godspeed` card but also with speed.

### Bypassing the `Elevate` Room
They'll then swap back to `Katana` to destroy the Laser Traps and killing the
`Godspeed` demon, just like in the other path. With a second `Godspeed`, in
hand, we have the ability to dash twice, jumping over the gap and skipping the
next room -- but just like with the first shortcut, we have to figure out how to
destroy the demons we're avoiding.

In this case, we can consider the fact that the `Elevate` room only had a Laser
Trap chain. As a result, we can clear the room with only a single shot through
the window. Again, the player is given the choice to discover how they may
optimize the route, but many of these are built into the level's design.

    src="{{ page.image_directory }}/hanging-gardens-sniper-shortcut-2.jpg"
    alt="The target inside of the elevate room">
  <figcaption>
    With two Godspeeds in hand, the player can dash over the gap to their
    right. But first, they'll need to target the Laser Trap chain inside.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

We then continue on the same waterfall path -- killing a few demons -- until we
end up at the intersection with the game's mystical Hand, hinting us towards a
shortcut.

### Clearing Your Heads
This is the game-hinted optimization, noted by the Hand in the diagram as well.
In good form, the hint shows you *where* to go but not how to get there. In this
case, touching the hint shows the player they can immediately drop onto the goal
to complete the level.

1. Collect 2 `Purify`s

1. Discard both `Purify`s, killing Head Demons, `Stomp` Demons, and Laser Trap
   chains.
1. Run off platform and discard `Stomp`, destroying all demons below and
   reaching the Finish

## Final Analysis

- 3 shots required at the start of the level, 4 shots in `Godspeed`
- Near end, 2x `Purify` and `Slam` used in similar ways for each route
