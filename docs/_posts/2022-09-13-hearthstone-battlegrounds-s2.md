## Understanding the Success of Battlegrounds
After almost 3 years in the running (including Beta access), *Hearthstone
Battlegrounds* has become one of the game's cornerstone modes, largely in part
to it's ease of entry.

Unlike the game's *Standard* mode, *Battlegrounds* doesn't require players to
build a deck, but instead form their Warband of minions to fight other players
during the game itself. As a result, there's not the same disparity between
casual and long-term players when it comes to a sizeable collection of cards for
building high-quality decks like there is in *Standard*.

This makes it easy to invite a friend to jump into a game without needing to
unlock cards for a given class or buy packs for the cards they're missing in
their collection. Better yet, players who haven't played in a while won't need
to craft all their old cards into new ones, but can jump right into the same
playing field as everyone else!

### A Brief Summary of Battlegrounds
In *Battlegrounds*, players compete against 7 others to be the last one
standing. Each round consists of two phases.

During the Recruit Phase, players buy minions from Bob's Tavern to add to their
Warband. Minions cost 3 Gold, though can later be sold back to Bob for 1 Gold.
Players start their first turn with 3 Gold, which increases by 1 Gold each turn
until reaching a max of 10 Gold.

In the Combat Phase, players are pitted 1v1 against a different, random opponent
in the game. Minions from each player take turns randomly attacking enemies
until one side has none remaining, at which point the winner attacks the loser.

Players must balance purchasing enough minions to avoid depleting their health
and losing with upgrading Bob's Tavern to improve the quantity and quality of
offered minions. Rounds continue, with players fighting different opponents
until only the victor remains.

### Previous Expansions
Since the initial release in late 2019, Blizzard has added a variety of factions
to *Battlegrounds*. The new factions enabled the set of cards in the game
(previously a fixed list of the 5 available factions) to vary, changing the meta
each game.

For example, high-health minions become more powerful if Murlocs are not
present, since Murlocs can consistently get the **Poison** buff, which destroys
minions when they take any damage.

The new factions also brought in fresh ideas to the format, since the game's
cards were first based off of existing cards from *Standard Hearthstone*. The
Quilboar faction, for example, added small buff spells called Bloodgems which
give permanent stats. The Naga, on the other hand, provide Spellcrafts, which
are more powerful, yet only buff a minion for one turn.

The development team also explored more powerful buffs with their Darkmoon Faire
expansion. During this special format *(no longer available)*, players would
choose one of three powerful spells every four turns, adding it to their hand.
This format was the standard for *Battlegrounds* for a while and was later
sprinkled into about 25% of matches for *Battlegrounds* Season 1.

### An Overview of Quests
For those who haven't played the newest update to *Battlegrounds*, here's a
quick explanation of how Quests work:

On your fourth turn, players are asked to choose from one of three quests. Each
quest has a goal, like "Lose or tie 3 combats" or "Spend 25 gold" which, once
completed, gives the player a reward, such as "You only need 2 copies of a
minion to make it Golden" or "After you Discover a card, get an extra copy of
it".

    On Turn 4, players must choose a Quest to help them scale later in the game.

The goals scale slightly based on the relative power of rewards. So, for
example, "Summon X minions" might be 20 for a lower-impact reward but 30 for a
higher-impact one. This can incentivize players to choose "worse" rewards if it
means they'll get it earlier and can power through the midgame.

Remember that getting 4th place or better is typically considered a "Win" since
there are eight players in each game, so 4th place is in the top 50%.

## A Deeper Dive into Quest Design
While Quests have no doubt shaken up the meta, I think it's important to
consider if the quests are expanding the game by changing the way players build
their Warbands or if they are only amplifying existing strategies.

The answer is both! But let's explore some of the different Quests to see why
that's the case.

### Quests that Worked

### Quests that Didn't Work

### Notes from Chat with Cade
most can be very overpowered but very few are not as good

Yeah, I feel like the stealth quest is made for combos like that, but to me, it
just makes baron/juggler feel more powerful than it already did
It's kind of one-dimensional

Re: The Friends Along the Way
yeah, though on other side, you can see it as 2 free coins

Compared to, I like the "Alter Ego" one where it's Evens and Odds
Since freezing minions can make them worse but also better
So it changes your playstyle

 I feel like if you don't complete your quest in like a couple turns, you're
 pretty hosed (But this is good -> Forces interaction)

 yeah, poison is pretty op rn
