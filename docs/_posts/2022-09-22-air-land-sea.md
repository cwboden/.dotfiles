## Overview
*Air, Land, & Sea* is a two-player WWII-themed game where each player is
attempting to control two of the three theaters (Air, Land, or Sea) over a
series of battles until they can declare victory!

With only 18 cards, the game is deceptively simple at first glace, but the
complexity is built from the order in which you play your cards:

Cards can be played face-up to their corresponding theater, where they will
trigger a powerful Tactical Ability. However, face-down cards can be played
to *any* theater and can later be flipped by other cards to trigger their
ability and provide additional reinforcement to that theater.

At the start of each battle, players are dealt six cards and will not draw any
more unless specified by a Tactical Ability. To win a theater, a player must
have the most Strength, determined by the large number at the top-left of each
card.

## Withdrawal
- Unique aspect of the game
- Encourages this "slow drip" of card play; don't want to scuff a strong hand
- Can also bluff by playing big cards early

### Reinforce
- Great turn 1 play
- Encourages the flip mechanic

### Escalation
- Turns the tide of the game
- Changes player strategy drastically

### Maneuver
- Demonstrates that flipping is the most interesting / core mechanic of gameplay
- Adjacency makes for interesting decisions / balancing acts

### Cover Fire
- Punny name
- Similar to Escalation -- compare/contrast

### Containment
- Also drastically changes the metagame
- Often bites you in the butt

## The Expansion: Lies, Spies, & Supplies
- Released in 2022
- Introduces 18 new cards, each a part of 3 new theaters
- Can be played independently (though the theming is slightly weaker, cards more
    nuanced than the base game)
- Interweave with base game by playing with 3 randomly chosen theaters

### Epic Mode
- Play 5 out of the 6 theaters, chosen randomly (we rotated one in each battle)
- Must win 3 out of the 5 theaters
- Dealt 10 cards instead of 6

### 3-4 Player Mode
- Hand split between two players, player with more cards must play
- At the beginning, they each exchange one card from their hand
- Communication is open between players
- Takes much longer, due to communication
- Talking in code is both fun *and* thematic with the war element
