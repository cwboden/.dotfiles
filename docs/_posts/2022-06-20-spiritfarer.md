## Overview
The game...is fun. I will go over the key mechanics in the game that made it
jump out to me.

## Resource Management
At its core, the game is focused on resource management. You have a ship to sail
around, collecting resources to construct buildings, upgrade dwellings, improve
your ship, and discover new frontiers.

### Teaching a Complex System
- New buildings / mechanics are slow-dripped to the player
- High accessibility, almost to a fault in explanation: "tutorials" (spirit
    explaining you how to do something) are fairly common, though they are
    important since many game concepts aren't explained at first (catching
    lightning, for example, is a spirit-gated event)
- So much to do, they really tightened the gameplay loop and preventing things
    from feeling stale. Common chores: gardening (two types), cooking meals,
    weaving thread / cloth, sawing logs, smelting ore, fishing, playing music to
    plants, diving for cargo, navigating jellyfish storms, feeding passengers,
    charting courses to new islands, answering the mail. Somehow all feels
    seamless, rarely have to think about "what's next"

### Balancing Simplicity with Replayability
Management games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, or Factorio are typically
full of minigames to add some spice to acquiring resources, crafting, etc. The
implementation of these mini games is an important part of the player experience
and can vastly change the game, even for the same resource.

For example, both Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley have a fishing minigame. In
Animal Crossing, the mechanics are straightforward -- if you see the shadow of a
fish in the water, you can throw out your line and wait for it to approach your
bobber. Then, once you get a bite, press `A` and reel it in! As long as you
press the button fast enough, the fish is yours.

However, in Stardew Valley, the fish don't appear in the water. Instead, you
cast out your line wherever you'd like. Eventually, a fish will bite and then
the minigame starts. A meter appears near your character, and you need to hold
`A` to keep the yellow bar over a moving fish icon.

    complexity of fishing in Stardew Valley may entice players to practice and
    return to it more often.

The tradeoff the two games make is between the depth of gameplay, the experience
to the player, and how it gates additional content or resources.

Animal Crossing creates a streamlined experience, possibly targeted at more
casual players, but at a cost of low skill-expression (some fish give you less
time to press `A` before fleeing). As a new player, it's easy to get into
fishing and see what waits for you out in the water. However, players may
eventually tire of the repetetive experience, especially since the main reason
to fish (in my opinion) is to populate the museum, so once you catch a fish
once, you probably aren't very interested in catching it again.

On the other hand, Stardew Valley gives players a minigame with deeper mechanics
at a cost of higher complexity. There are bobbers you can use to change how the
yellow bar moves and different fish have various patterns of movement --
sometimes you can even recognize which fish you're going to catch before seeing
it! The added nuance encourages players to return to fishing when they discover
a new bobber or unlock bait, but fishing initially may have a higher ramp-up.
There's even progression baked into the game: your yellow bar starts very small
but grows as your character levels up, so while "core" players may appreciate
the challenge, it can be difficult to start out as a new player.

Now let's consider Spiritfarer's fishing minigame. The gameplay is similar to
Stardew Valley: players can fish whenever they'd like, casting their line into
the water and pressing `A` when there's a bite. Instead of a meter, the fish
will move away from the player while you can hold `A` to reel in the fish. If
the line is in danger of snapping, the entire rod will turn from vibrant yellow
to deep crimson until, if the player refuses to let go, the line will snap. You
catch the fish by pulling it in close enough without snapping the line.

At its core, Spiritfarer's fishing game is similar to Stardew Valley, but it
manages to improve the player experience in two ways:

First, the player initially cannot snap the line at all, and therefore will
always catch the first. Early on, the game is intent on teaching players *how*
to fish, though you are only able to catch a subset of fish (as well as lots of
trash, like the classic Old Shoe). This allows players to learn the minigame
with low-stakes, especially since there are a bunch of other activities on the
ship they could be doing instead.

Second, even once the line-snapping mechanic is introduced, it's still much
harder to lose the fish than in Stardew Valley. The line will snap if the player
doesn't respect the line turning red, but otherwise the fish will stay on the
line. Comparably, in Stardew Valley, the green meter can reach zero if you
aren't keeping the bar over the fish enough, at which point it will flee. New
Spiritfarer players will still be able to catch fish, even if it takes them
longer than someone more experienced.

By lowering the skill floor, Spiritfarer's fishing is approachable, but still
allows for deeper player expression. The developers hit a sweet-spot where
fishing is relaxing but also fun to return to.  I often found myself casting my
line in new waters, hoping to find some new fish. There's even areas on the map
for fishing-specific events, but I'll leave that you to to play!

### Handling Scale
Another tricky balancing act management games have to play is around scaling the
game with player progress. There should be a sense of active progression
throughout the game -- players want to feel like they're improving and be able
to grow with the game.

In a management game, where progress is often gated by the acquisition of
resources, scale typically revolves around how to balance the sources and sinks
of resources. This allows players to progress semi-linearly with respect to the
non-linear scaling of incoming resources.

In Factorio, for example, creating higher-level components requires
significantly more materials and time.

<figure class="align-right">
  <img
    src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/factorio-assembly-machine-3-recipe.png"
    alt="Factorio Level 3 assembly machine recipe">
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

A Level 3 assembling machine requires two Level 2 assembling machines, which
means upgrading all of your Level 2 assembling machines is quite an expensive
operation.

This works in a game where crafting and automation go hand-in-hand. The player
is incentivized to build things not by hand, but by a chained-together array
of mining rigs, belts, and assembly machines that all combine together to make
Factorio fun! While it can be increasingly expensive to craft upgraded items,
that is an intentional game mechanic so that players are, well, actually playing
Factorio.

But for a game like Animal Crossing, for example, where crafting, despite it's
fun and peppy animation, takes a tedious amount of time (~3 sec per craft). This
may not seem like a long time, but if you are crafting something expendable,
like bait, you'll spend minutes crafting supplies that will be used up fairly
quickly. As a result, Animal Crossing doesn't have many recipes that require
multiple steps of crafting (i.e. Craft A to make B to make C) so that players
are rarely spending copious amounts of time crafting, since it's only a minor
component of the game -- at least, compared to Factorio.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img
    src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/animal-crossing-crafting.jpg"
    alt="Animal Crossing crafting animation">
  <figcaption>
    The crafting experience in Animal Crossing prioritizes its whimsical art
    style and snappy animations.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

As a result, crafting in Animal Crossing can -- after enough time -- feel like a
gateway to playing the game, rather than a fun mechanic to enjoy.  Crafting can
become a chore because there's not much player expression in the process.

In Factorio, automating crafting is exciting. Once you have a few assembling
machines doing your bidding, you can stop spending time crafting basic
components and start thinking about what you'll build next and -- perhaps more
importantly -- how you'll accomplish it.

But in Animal Crossing, crafting is done out of necessity. If you want to catch
a bug, you'll need to craft a new net after yours breaks.

The tradeoff, though, similar to the fishing example from the previous section,
is approachability. Factorio is far from the casual experience that is Animal
Crossing. And I don't think Factorio is "better" than Animal Crossing or
vice-versa. The key point is that balancing the feel and speed of progression in
the game is a necessary consideration for game developers.

So now, let's consider how Spiritfarer does it. First, let's examine all of the
different materials:

#### Spiritfarer Resources

|Class|Stages|Types|
|---|---|
|Wood|Logs, Planks|Maple, Oak, Ash, Pine|
|Rocks|Rock, Powder|Limestone, Coal, Slate, Quartz, Marble|
|Metals|Ore, Ingots, Sheets|Copper, Iron, Aluminum, Zinc, Silver, Gold, Pulsar|
|Cloths|Fibre, Thread, Fabric|Linen, Wool, Cotton, Nebula, Silk|
|Food|Seeds, Fruits & Veggies, Fish, Meat, Dishes|Apples, Turnips, Corn, Mackerel, and many more|

Wow, looks like a lot! But each "Class" of materials are all harvested and then
crafted in roughly the same way:
- Trees, regardless of type, are chopped down into Logs and can then be refined
  into planks at the Sawmill.
- Fibre is obtained from plants or sheep, then placed in the Loom to be woven
  into thread which can be put in the Loom *again* to be re-woven into fabric.
- Food is placed in the kitchen oven to be turned into a variety of meals.

Each of these processes involves another minigame where players are challenged
to improve their skills, though the game maintains a low skill floor to ensure
inexperienced players will not be gated by their inability to saw logs, for
example.

</figure>

In the Sawmill minigame, players must align the blade with the dotted, yellow
line for each log they saw. Based on how well aligned it is, the players will
get 1 - 4 Planks. Similar to fishing, the design allows experienced players to
benefit from higher yields as they improve, while preventing players from being
completely unable to produce wood if they don't get it perfectly right.

- Difficulty scales with the Type rather than the class
- Same minigame, but a ramp in difficulty
- Always some yield (e.g. at least one wood from sawing)

## Platforming
- Focus on management, but platforming is a core part of the game
- Events require player to platform around their ship to acquire resources
    (lightning, jellyfish, nebula, fireglow)
- Cleverly coupled with ship layout for buildings, which makes platforming
    considerations another part of the management cycle -- very clever!

## Interwoven Design
- Cooking Food -> Spirits -> Abilities
- Platforming -> Farming -> Crafting
- Events -> Spirits -> [Tutorial, Character Development]
- Laying out buildings -> Platforming minigames
- Events -> Characters (e.g. Talking w/ Olga + harvesting resources on her)
- Linking systems together: food makes spirits happy, you can cook different
    foods, need to feed them anyways, might as well have fun / try to see what
    they like. Certain ingredients also tie these mechanics together: Sunflower
    seeds are grown but then used in the Crusher to become a craftable
    component. Resources like the Fireglow are acquired from a platforming
    event, but then must be grown to be used. Some spirits are also linked to
    certain events, like Gwen and the Jellyfish storms, creating a trifecta of
    tutorial-like teaching, character development, and interwoven gameplay which
    makes it feel less like a "minigame" and more like an experience.

## Co-op
- 2-player coop (see how this is?)

## Copious, Consistent Art and Animation
One of the most striking parts of the game is the art. Hand-drawn, consistent,
beautiful.

### In Art
- Satisfying animations: Opening the oven, sound of watering plants, casting the
    fishing rod, jumps / flips move into each other. Sometimes they get
    repetitive, like after many hours of water plants, for example.
- Relaxing aesthetic. Important for a management game that can cause player
    burnout. Some characters even remind you to do more chill things (Atul
    asking the player why they don't fish anymore)
- Spirits are extemely different, emphasized by their sprites

### In UX
- Smart controls / scenes to incentivise / highlight the beauty: pausing and
    showing new islands as they're discovered, pressing a button to disable the
    HUD, outline of character sprites before they become "full spirits"
- Button mapping is user-oriented for simplicity, 4 core buttons, nothing mapped
    to the d-pad (except movement), nothing mapped to the right-stick

### In the Narrative
- Organic characters: Join you on the island for specific character-related
    activities like gathering berries, buying supplies, etc.
- Players can walk through the individual spirits' stories at their own pace,
    since the spirits live "naturally" on the boat, but will grow as you provide
    more ameneties, continue their signature quests

## Conclusion
You might like this game if:
- You like relaxing, story-driven, management games with some light platforming
    thrown in
- You liked Sea of Thieves, Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, Project Highrise,
    LoZ: Windwaker / Phantom Hourglass

You might not like this game if:
- You want to automate most of your resource management (a la Factorio)
- You want a game with more action / combat / control-based character expression
- You don't get attached to characters / that isn't enough to push you to drive
    the story forward
