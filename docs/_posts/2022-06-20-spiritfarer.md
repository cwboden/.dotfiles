## Overview
The game...is fun.

## Key Mechanics

### Resource Management
- Management games are typically full of (sometimes-grindy) minigames.
    Spiritfarer improves on the formula by altering the minigames as the game
    continues, challenging players to refine their skills. Sometimes this falls
    flat (gardening, foundry)

#### Teaching a Complex System
- High accessibility, almost to a fault in explanation: "tutorials" (spirit
    explaining you how to do something) are fairly common, though they are
    important since many game concepts aren't explained at first (catching
    lightning, for example, is a spirit-gated event)
- So much to do, they really tightened the gameplay loop and preventing things
    from feeling stale. Common chores: gardening (two types), cooking meals,
    weaving thread / cloth, sawing logs, smelting ore, fishing, playing music to
    plants, diving for cargo, navigating jellyfish storms, feeding passengers,
    charting courses to new islands, answering the mail. Somehow all feels
    seamless, rarely have to think about "what's next"

#### Handling Scale
- Unlike a game like Factorio, the resources required change instead of becoming
    quadratically more difficult. This prevents there being a significant grind
    for chaining resources like fiber (fiber into thread into cloth). There can
    then be changes in how those are combined

Core Resources:
- Wood (Oak, Maple, Ash) -> Planks
- Thread (Linen, Wool, Cotton, Nebula)
- Ore (Copper, Iron) -> Ingots
- Minerals (Coal, Slate, Limestone)
- Food (Grain, Veggie, Fish, Meat, etc.)

### Platforming
- Focus on management, but platforming is a core part of the game
- Events require player to platform around their ship to acquire resources
    (lightning, jellyfish, nebula, fireglow)
- Cleverly coupled with ship layout for buildings, which makes platforming
    considerations another part of the management cycle -- very clever!

### Interwoven Design
- Cooking Food -> Spirits -> Abilities
- Platforming -> Farming -> Crafting
- Events -> Spirits -> [Tutorial, Character Development]
- Laying out buildings -> Platforming minigames
- Events -> Characters (e.g. Talking w/ Olga + harvesting resources on her)
- Linking systems together: food makes spirits happy, you can cook different
    foods, need to feed them anyways, might as well have fun / try to see what
    they like. Certain ingredients also tie these mechanics together: Sunflower
    seeds are grown but then used in the Crusher to become a craftable
    component. Resources like the Fireglow are acquired from a platforming
    event, but then must be grown to be used. Some spirits are also linked to
    certain events, like Gwen and the Jellyfish storms, creating a trifecta of
    tutorial-like teaching, character development, and interwoven gameplay which
    makes it feel less like a "minigame" and more like an experience.

### Co-op
- 2-player coop (see how this is?)

## The Power of Polish
One of the most striking parts of the game is the art. Hand-drawn, consistent,
beautiful.

### In Art
- Satisfying animations: Opening the oven, sound of watering plants, casting the
    fishing rod, jumps / flips move into each other. Sometimes they get
    repetitive, like after many hours of water plants, for example.
- Relaxing aesthetic. Important for a management game that can cause player
    burnout. Some characters even remind you to do more chill things (Atul
    asking the player why they don't fish anymore)
- Spirits are extemely different, emphasized by their sprites

### In UX
- Smart controls / scenes to incentivise / highlight the beauty: pausing and
    showing new islands as they're discovered, pressing a button to disable the
    HUD, outline of character sprites before they become "full spirits"
- Button mapping is user-oriented for simplicity, 4 core buttons, nothing mapped
    to the d-pad (except movement), nothing mapped to the right-stick

### In the Narrative
- Organic characters: Join you on the island for specific character-related
    activities like gathering berries, buying supplies, etc.
- Players can walk through the individual spirits' stories at their own pace,
    since the spirits live "naturally" on the boat, but will grow as you provide
    more ameneties, continue their signature quests

## Themes

### Prominence of Death / Loss
- While a key factor, the game doesn't dwell on this side of things too much
- Characters are taken to the gate and you hear their final musings about their
    life and experience, but typically they are full of acceptance
- Stages of Loss? (Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance) Maybe can
    highlight Gwen or Summer?
- Most characters don't move through the stages of grief regarding their own
    passing but instead have some "task" to finish while still in the world.
    Typically these goals are symbolic for another aspect of their life: e.g.
    "The dragon" is representative of Summer's cancer. "The darkness" of the
    jellyfish is representative of Gwen's suicidal anxiety. Atul, who is
    consistently positive and who's death isn't explained, doesn't seem to have
    much anxiety around his special event (lightning, though maybe related to a
    heart attack / defibrilator, given his stature and love of greasy foods)
- Stella (you) know most of the spirits in some way. Why is that? What does it
    say about your experience as the Spiritfarer?

### An Inclusive Environment
- Focus on defining an inclusive world, not pandering / pushing a message
- Characters come from a variety of backgrounds / identities, but all spirits
    are accepting within the game
- Similar to Schitt's Creek?

## Conclusion
You might like this game if:
- You like relaxing, story-driven, management games with some light platforming
    thrown in
- You liked Sea of Thieves, Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, Project Highrise,
    LoZ: Windwaker / Phantom Hourglass

You might not like this game if:
- You want to automate most of your resource management (a la Factorio)
- You want a game with more action / combat / control-based character expression
- You don't get attached to characters / that isn't enough to push you to drive
    the story forward
