- Management games are typically full of (sometimes-grindy) minigames.
    Spiritfarer improves on the formula by altering the minigames as the game
    continues, challenging players to refine their skills. Sometimes this falls
    flat (gardening, foundry)

- Satisfying animations: Opening the oven, sound of watering plants, casting the
    fishing rod, jumps / flips move into each other

- Smart controls / scenes to incentivise / highlight the beauty: pausing and
    showing new islands as they're discovered, pressing a button to disable the
    HUD, outline of character sprites before they become "full spirits"

- Linking systems together: food makes spirits happy, you can cook different
    foods, need to feed them anyways, might as well have fun / try to see what
    they like

- High accessibility, almost to a fault in explanation: "tutorials" (spirit
    explaining you how to do something) are fairly common, though they are
    important since many game concepts aren't explained at first (catching
    lightning, for example, is a spirit-gated event)

- So much to do, they really tightened the gameplay loop and preventing things
    from feeling stale. Common chores: gardening (two types), cooking meals,
    weaving thread / cloth, sawing logs, smelting ore, fishing, playing music to
    plants, diving for cargo, navigating jellyfish storms, feeding passengers,
    charting courses to new islands, answering the mail. Somehow all feels
    seamless, rarely have to think about "what's next"

- 2-player coop (see how this is?)
