Attended an abroad program in Germany and designed a series of programs, each
designed for the `m3pi` robot *(above)* to move with a specific purpose.

The first script allowed for manual control via Bluetooth and recorded lap times
around a track. The next script automated the track-following process through a
PD controller. This algorithm was also simulated in MATLAB to optimize the input
parameters, increasing overall speed. The last part of the project was to enable
the robot to follow a warehouse map to a series of waypoints and return to its
starting position.
