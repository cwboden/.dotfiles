Designed and created a user-detecting smart shower that uses ultrasonic sensors
and user input to schedule, preheat, and save water during showers. In addition
to the ultrasonic sensors, the final design involved the integration of
solenoids, a thermistor, a numberic keypad, two servos attached to a gimbal, a
serial display, a power relay, and the SmartFusion FPGA board.

The team included four team members and a budget of $200 with the goal of
designing a marketable product. The source code is not available to the public
due to the University of Michigan Engineering Honor Code, but the project
poster, used during the demo day, is below.
