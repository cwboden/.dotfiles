As part of EECS 573: Advanced Topics in Computer Architecture, my lab partner
and I designed a simulator to test a programmable prefetcher.  The idea was to
create a prefetcher that could be tuned to match specific work loads.  For
example, prefetching could be more aggressive when it will lead to more hits in
the cache.
