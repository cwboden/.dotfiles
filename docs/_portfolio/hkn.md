The Beta Epsilon chapter of HKN is composed of the top electrical, computer, and
computer science engineers at the University of Michigan. I served on the
officer corps as treasurer, corporate relations, president, and now advisor.

As treasurer, I managed funds during the semester including reimbursements,
company invoices, and member dues. As the corporate relations officer, I served
as the corporate liason for our chapter. I organized tech talks, sponsorships,
and speakers at our general meetings.

In my last role as president, my semester vision was to engage electing members
within the organization and ensure a strong infrastructure for the coming years.
Furthermore, I sought to orchestrate the reopening of our fundraising cafe,
which had been closed for the past 4 semester. The electee class was 50% larger
than the previous semester and a packet of required documents and information
was sent out to the Office of the Provost to reopen the cafe.
