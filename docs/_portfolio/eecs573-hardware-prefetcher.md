As part of EECS 573: Advanced Topics in Computer Architecture, my lab partner
and I designed a simulator to test a programmable prefetcher.  The idea was to
create a prefetcher that could be tuned to match specific work loads.  For
example, prefetching could be more aggressive when it will lead to more hits in
the cache.  The final report and presentation are below.
