Ada Developers Academy is a non-profit, cost-free coding school for women and
gender expansive adults. We primarily serve Black, Latine, Indigenous Americans,
Native Hawaiian & Pacific Islander, LGBTQIA+, and low-income people. I work as
a mentor in the program which creates opportunities for tech professionals to
use their skills to support underrepresented new developers.

I've served as a mentor throughout the past three cohorts, providing guidance to
a half-dozen students, all of which have gone onto receive full-time offers in
the industry. We meet weekly to give insight on tech culture, job hunting,
networking tips, and interviewing.

In addition, I've contributed to the course curriculum on GitHub, helping
the transition to covering Python and React as intro languages and frameworks.
The organization has been a great way to still teach, even as a member of the
software industry.
