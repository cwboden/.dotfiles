In this special topics course, we were introduced to many topics in computer
education research (CER).  We learned about designing our own studies such as
multi-institutional multi-national, laboratory, and classroom studies.  Research
was grounded in theory from learning sciences, educational psychology, and
science education.

The class included a research proposal with a $100k/year budget over a maximum
of five years.  My study focused on determining the benefits of learning
computational tools like Git or GDB with respect to understanding other
computational topics.  Essentially, does learning how to use computing tools
impact understanding of other computing topics?  The report and presentation are
below.
