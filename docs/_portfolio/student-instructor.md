Worked as an assistant to professors in EECS 370: Introduction to Computer
Organization and EECS 470: Introduction to Computer Architecture. Standard IA
responsibilities include hosting office hours, answering student questions on
Piazza, and grading assignments.

In EECS 370, I personally managed the course website and calendar and hosted a
discussion section of 40 students.  In EECS 470, I helped students automate
their test suites and lead two of the three lab sections.

As a GSI, I taught EECS 370: Introductory to Computer Organization.  Managed the
staff of 13 Instructional Aides to help teach a class of around 600 students.  I
introduced new content to the course, such as a revamped autograder, updated
admin request document for students, and revised lecture and discussion slides.

After a semester as a GSI for EECS 370, I was lucky enough to be a student
lecturer for the class.  The course intends to give students a basic
understanding of how computer execute programs, helping them work with the
hardware to have a processor carry out a task.

This class is a personal favorite of mine that many students are unhappy they
have to take.  As a hardware class, much of the content may seem irrelevant to
the majority of computer science students who take the course.  Nonetheless, I
hope to garner interest with slides focused on active learning, clear examples,
and thought-provoking projects.  The other lectureres, Professors Brehob and
Mudge, and I have worked hard this summer to give the class a polish.  We have
finishing updating the autograder, fixed some issues in the slides, and created
new reference materials for students to use.
