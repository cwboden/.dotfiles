## Other Ideas
- All resources are converted into energy every (few?) turns?
- Must produce enough energy, on those turns when you can convert, perhaps
- Some assets can produce just energy directly (solar, wind, etc.)
- Some assets can increase the conversion rates of resources to energy
- Stages of the game w/ limited assets and goals. E.g. 1920s w/ no solar/wind or
    2020s where climate impact is now a factor. Have to reach certain threshold
    of energy for a number of rounds.
- Upgrade buildings
- Negative pipeline add-ons?
