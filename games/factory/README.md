## Other Ideas
- All resources are converted into energy every (few?) turns?
- Must produce enough energy, on those turns when you can convert, perhaps
- Some assets can produce just energy directly (solar, wind, etc.)
- Some assets can increase the conversion rates of resources to energy
- Stages of the game w/ limited assets and goals. E.g. 1920s w/ no solar/wind or
    2020s where climate impact is now a factor. Have to reach certain threshold
    of energy for a number of rounds.
- Upgrade buildings
- Negative pipeline add-ons?
- Rarity of assets
- More intermediate types
- Notify player of assets that won't produce
- Prereq buildings as a "technology tree" of sorts
- Draft assets from various "groups" based on categories / resource
- "Collapse" buildings into one -- related to "parenthetical" buildings

## Dan's thoughts
 - Draft: Based on existing pipeline to know what you'll be able to produce for
     the future -> More decisions if we add cost
 - Finding some long-term goals:
    - Upgrades to buildings?
    - Upgrade-based buildings (e.g. Mines general more coal)
    - Bake this in via baseline consumers consume more  than producer
 - More outputs required (e.g. food, luxury products, maintenance?). Bonuses for
     exceeding expectations
     - Different requirements have different scaling (e.g. linear / quadratic)
     - This could also apply to assets, which have linear / quadratic production
 - Disparity between resources to incentivize future decisions (surplus or lack)
 - Multiple lanes for production, multi-lane assets? Lanes based on resources /
     output goals?
 - Do we need "Final" consumers, or can the player allocate at will
 - Adding a "turning point" from building engine parts to building "points"
 - Can buy multiple assets per round, but now limited by money

```
F: _ | _ M M _
E: S'| < > _ F
H: _ _ _ P C _
```

- Possibly add cross-lane complexity during building upgrades
- Producer buildings that upgrade into consumers -- thinking more about where
    buildings "sit"
- Assets produce more when next to identical ones? Influences placement
- Add stages as the game goes on, choose top/bottom, reduces overlap cards
