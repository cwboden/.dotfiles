MESSAGE A wild road hog in it's natural habitat

.P....F.

MESSAGE The first victim: a frog, merely looking to cross the road.

MESSAGE Only picking at its prey, the Hogger is too proud to run its kill over again.
MESSAGE But where won't this beast go in pursuit of poor, helpless frogs?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.P....FF....FF.
...FF....FF....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MESSAGE Truly relentless.
MESSAGE Perhaps a fork in the road can stop the rampage?

MESSAGE Alas.
MESSAGE The frogs dash into the side streets, but the Hogger follows.

MESSAGE The tiny alleyways are no match for the fearless screeches of the beast's jet-black feet.

MESSAGE The beast hungers now for something more...
MESSAGE Not just the road and everything on it.
MESSAGE More than the empty lots it's claimed as territory.
MESSAGE The ultimate prize: A community built with an identical thirst.
MESSAGE To rely on and provide for the Hogger.
MESSAGE Game Over
